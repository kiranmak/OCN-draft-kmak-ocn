                      draft-km-intarea-ocn-latest

Abstract

   This text formulates a specialized network concept to support
   communication constraints in automated systems.  These specialized
   networks, formulated as Operations and Control networks (OCN), are
   significant to many application scenarios involving the control and
   monitoring of mechanical and digital devices.  The document defines
   the OCN reference model, describing the associated components,
   interfaces, and reference points.  The reference model is independent
   of any specific technology.  Standardized mechanisms will facilitate
   large-scale machine-to-machine communication and help with the
   integration between OCN and the Internet.

1.  Introduction

   A number of applications require specialized networks to perform
   operations that change or monitor the behavior of equipment and the
   environment in which they operate.  Such application domains benefit
   from software-driven process automation with the ability to control
   and detect changes remotely.

   Traditionally, equipment related control processes and monitoring
   mechanisms are associated with the production plants and
   manufacturing environments.  Moreover, growth in the Internet of
   Things (IoT) has broadened the role of operations, control, and
   process automation into a diverse set of market verticals and
   commercial applications.

   For example, residents can control door locks remotely at home and
   can observe visitors at the door with the surveillance cameras.
   Networks with in a vehicle are used to coordinate the entire engine
   operations including speed control, tire pressure, collision
   detection, and avoidance mechanisms.  These operations are performed
   through intelligent software without human-in-the-loop.  In a large-
   scale energy power distribution system, control units in substations
   monitor real-time power consumption and perform automatic load re-
   distribution across different sub-stations to prevent outages.

   The scenarios described above are common in the sense they all
   involve operating an equipment (such as a machine) through
   communication between a controller device (e.g.  PLC) and an
   actuating or a sensing device.

   The essential characteristics of networks between these devices are
   delivery of a command to a machine with high-precision, its safety,
   reliability and security.  This implies low or no tolerance to
   latency and packet losses (among other things covered later).

   Since there are several such applications, a common connectivity
   interface is required between the different components.

   An Operation and Control Network (OCN) is the interconnection of
   field devices (actuators, sensors) and their associated controllers
   to exchange data to cause and monitor changes to the end-equipment.
   Each OCN connection is designed or provisioned to fulfill the traffic
   characteristics with stringent time and reliability constraints such
   as protecting bounded latency and not allowing packet losses.

   OCN, itself is not a new concept in itself.  Other industrial network
   technologies that would be classified as OCN are available, albeit
   with limited functionalities and at a smaller scale.  Whereas, demand
   for improvements in process automation at a large scale is growing
   across diverse applications.  Thus, a broader and more generalized
   approach will benefit several industry verticals.

   OCN integrates automation infrastructure beyond a single location to
   multiple sites and even to the cloud; it additionally integrates
   existing industrial network technologies.  OCN aims to formalize the
   mechanisms for interaction between the OCN components.

   The rest of the document represents the OCN taxonomy and a detail
   description of OCN concepts.

2.  Terminology

   *  Operational technology (OT): Programmable systems or devices that
      interact with the physical environment (or manage devices that
      interact with the physical environment).  These systems/devices
      detect or cause a direct change through the monitoring and/or
      control of devices, processes, and events.  Examples include
      industrial control systems, building management systems, fire
      control systems, and physical access control mechanisms.  Source:
      [NIST-OT]

   *  Industry Automation: Mechanisms that enable the machine-to-machine
      communication by use of technologies that enable automatic control
      and operation of industrial devices and processes leading to
      minimizing human intervention.

   *  Control Loop: Control loops are part of process control systems in
      which desired process response is provided as an input to the
      controller, which performs the corresponding action (using
      actuators) and reads the output values.  Since no error correction
      is performed, these are called open control loops.

   *  Feedback Control Loop: Feedback control loop is a system in which
      the output of a control system is continuously measured and
      compared to the input reference value.  The controller uses any
      deviation from the input value to adjust the output value for the
      desired response.  Since there is a feedback of error signal to
      the input, these are called closed control loops.

   *  Industrial Control Networks: The industrial control networks are
      interconnection of equipments used for the operation, control or
      monitoring of machines in the industry environment.  It involves
      different level of communications - between fieldbus devices,
      digital controllers and software applications

   *  Human Machine Interface: An interface between the operator and the
      machine.  The communication interface relays I/O data back and
      forth between an operator's terminal and HMI software to control
      and monitor equipment.

3.  Operation and Control Networks

3.1.  Definition

   The Operations and Control Networks are defined as follows:

      An Operation and Control Network (OCN) is a network that supports
      all the capabilities necessary to accomplish a process or control
      command execution on actuators for the desired effect prescribed
      by the controllers based on continuous inputs from the sensory
      data and application requests.

   An OCN is used to connect three basic types of functional devices -
   actuators, sensors and controllers.  They are well-known in the
   industry control systems (ICS) and are generalized to include all
   kinds of OCN scenarios.  The sensors and the actuators are associated
   with physical, logical, or digital entities that can be observed,
   monitored, or caused to move or change.  An OCN connects field
   devices, with the controllers and associates them for the exchange of
   data to trigger and monitor changes to achieve desired effect.

      Note: the term "OCN field device" will be used to represent
      actuator and sensors together.

   OCN relates to Operational Technology (OT) in ICS and extends it.
   While OT networks are commonly engineered over a limited physical
   range in a geographic area, OCNs improve upon conventional OT by
   supporting large-scale network layer connectivity paradigms.
   Logically, OCNs facilitate connectivity across larger geographical
   areas, for instance, beyond factory premises covering several cloud
   and edge scenarios in which components are disaggregated or are not
   co-located.  Of course, physical distance limits still apply to
   applications with strict requirement of control command completion.

   OCN provides inter-networking or mechanisms to interact between
   controlling and monitoring components (that maybe remote) with the
   field devices close to the operating machinery and the equipment.

   The OCNs support different types of messages across these function
   elements.  The message data sent from controller to actuator is
   smaller than a typical network payload.  Packet delivery must be
   guaranteed by the OCN.  Additionally, the OCN should support and
   advertise mechanisms to eliminate packet losses.

   Most common attributes among OCN enabled applications are different
   types of guarantees of time for different operations, safety of those
   operations, and the reliability of data delivered.  In addition
   security and privacy are also more critical than the general-pupose
   applications.  These characteristics are covered in
   Section Section 5.

3.2.  Reference Model

   The following three reference points for OCNs are of interest:
   Actuator Point, Sensor Point, and Controller Point.

      Note: Suggestions on naming anything is OK.  I am not happy with
      any of these names.

       Figure 1: Operations & Control Networks(OCN) - Reference Model

   An 'operation' in OCN can be any of the following -

   *  accessing information from the field-sensors,

   *  writing command data,

   *  reading back from the actuators.

   The Figure 1 above is a reference model for the OCN.  An application
   executes operation on field-devices over OCN to monitor specific and/
   or overall state of the system; An operation may involve realizing
   feedback control loop between the controller, actuating and sensory
   devices.

   The OCN Reference model is extended to accommodate a variety of
   access networks.  In fact, it serves as convergent network to
   integrate communication across different technology specific
   networks.  Consider it as a specialized network infrastructure
   (shared or dedicated) that interconnects different other OT-enabled
   access networks.  Some of the examples of OT-enabled networks are
   Ethernet/IP, Profinet, TSN [TSNTG], Detnet[DETNET-ARCH], 5G radio,
   private 5G, etc.  As is implied that each of these technologies are
   by themselves capable of supporting some of the properties of OCN
   which in turn provides a comprehensive approach to integration of
   these technologies at large-scale to build a converged framework.

   A generalized OCN model supports the following logical connection
   points:

3.2.1.  Controller Point (CP)

   A controller point is a logical entity authorized to interface with
   the sensors and actuators over the OCN.  The CP has the knowledge of
   an application's performance parameters which are expressed in terms
   of network specific requests or resources such as, tolerance to
   packet loss, latency-limits, jitter variance, bandwidth, and
   specification for safety.  The CPs should have knowledge about these
   capabilities from the OCNs in order to meet their packet delivery
   constraints.  Since OCNs are expected to be shared among different
   applications with their own set of KPI, a controller should be used
   to express its specific requirements in the OCN.  Moreover, each
   command from controller may have to indicate its own KPI.

   An important aspect of the controller function element is that it
   integrates with the application infrastructure and provides a
   standard interface with them.  Optionally, it may be an application
   in itself.

3.2.2.  Actuation Point (AP)

   An actuation point is the functional element which receives actuator
   specific commands and is used for the communication between the
   actuator devices and controllers.  The OCN enables control of
   actuating devices remotely from the controller by meeting all the
   requirements (KPIs) necessary for a successful command execution.
   The actuator participates in closed control loop over OCN with CP
   when necessary.

   The standard network specific interface between the controller and
   actuator is called AP-I (see Section 4.1).

3.2.3.  Sensor Point (SP)

   The sensor point is the point where sensor connects to.  Its main
   function is to emit periodic data from the sensors.  It may
   intermittently provide asynchronous readings upon request from the
   controller.

   A sensor point is the functional element from where sensory data is
   emitted back to controller.  SP may receive initial requests to emit
   data with certain periodicity or may provide realtime data upon
   request.  The communication to sensor is also through a controller
   since controller is involved in using sensory data to change
   parameters in actuators.

   The OCN enables delivery of data emitted from sensor devices to the
   controller networks by meeting all the application demands in
   particular periodicity and severity of the observed data.  The
   standard network specific interface between the controller and sensor
   is called SP-I (see Section 4.2).

4.  OCN Communication Interfaces

   OCN interfaces enable communication between its reference points; two
   specific interfaces are defined below.  Additionally, an application
   to CP interface is also anticipated to express application logic.

4.1.  Actuator Point Interface

   Interface between CP and AP is called AP-I.  It carries out
   communication between the actuation points and the controller points.
   The Actuators are designed to receive "control command" from
   controllers and perform corresponding action or change to the
   equipment.  Those commands can be abstracted as writes and then read-
   back of values.  Thus, the message may be request write and then
   request read-back in reply.  The high-precision timing and delivery
   of such messages must be met in either direction independently.  This
   interface is a bidirectional and the model allows more than one
   controller interacting with the AP.

4.2.  Sensor Point Interface

   Interface between CP and SP is called SP-I.  It describes the set of
   messages permitted between the sensor points and controller points.
   The Sensors may be programmed to send periodic sensory data at
   specified intervals.  There may also be other cases, in which the
   controller may .solicit reading values.  The interface should be a
   bi-directional and more than on controller can request sensor data.

                       +--------------+

                        Figure 2: Interfaces in OCN

      Note: Direct sensor to actuator communication is not in the scope
      of OCN for the following reasons:

      1.  In this model, actuator and sensors do not have 'decision-
          making' capabilities.  They perform requested tasks as
          instructed.  In other words, they are passive actors.  The
          tasks performed by these field-devices themselves maybe
          autonomous but do not change their behavior or react to
          changing conditions once programmed.  Providing a direct
          communication between sensor and actuator could potentially
          leave controller out-of-sync or the operations in
          unpredictable state.

      2.  It is likely that several applications are interested in
          reading sensors for offline analysis and do not intend to
          changes the state in control processes.  For such cases, it
          helps to have limited set of permitted messages and prevent
          from executing undesirable actions.

4.3.  Application Interface

   An application domain combines everythin - the application logic,
   group of actuators, sensors and one or more controllers.  With in the
   application domain the interface between controller and application
   logic is called application interface (API).  The API allows
   applications to request specific outcomes or data from the field
   devices through the CPs.  It is possible to have controller point
   embedded in an application, in such cases this interface may not be
   needed.

5.  OCN Characteristics

   The characteristics of OCN differentiate it from the general purpose
   networks of today which provide the end user (humans or non-critical
   applications) connectivity to a plethora of services (web, media
   streaming, data transfers, e-commerce etc), rarely involving machine-
   to-machine type communications.

   These characteristics include the type of communication messages and
   other key aspects of OCNs.

5.1.  OCN Message Classification

   The OCNs are designed for the real-time applications with the
   assurance of successful command delivery.  The time or high-precision
   requirements can be classified in three different ways - in-time (the
   message arrives before a specified time), on-time (the message
   arrives exactly at the specified time) and bounded time (the message
   is arrives in a given range of specified time window).

   Another consideration about the message delivery in OCNs concern with
   the target of a message, i.e. that parameter represents communication
   time or processing time i.e. an end-to-end execution of commands.

   The functional behavior of OCN can be explained through
   classification of messages as described below.

5.1.1.  In-time messages

   In-time messages supply data to receivers before the specified time
   parameters.  The messages may originate from either direction. i.e.,
   controller to field devices or vice-versa.  Controller to/from field
   device messages must reach with in the specified time.  An in-time
   request originating from the controller to actuator will specify the
   maximal delay permissible time, in which requested operation must
   take place.

      Note: todo - The OCN must support mechanisms related to relative
      time knowledge across the domain.  However those mechanisms are
      out of scope of this document.

5.1.2.  Bounded latency messages

   Bounded latency message requests correspond to a given the earliest
   and the latest arrival time, or a range of time in which that
   operation must take place.  This type of request is different from
   in-time messages because of the additional constraint that message
   should not be processed too early but processed in a given interval.

5.1.3.  On-time messages

   The on-time messages supply data at a specific time with tolerance
   for only a very small difference (in terms of measurable unit)
   between the earliest and latest time-values.  On-time message
   guarantees complement in-time services.  On-time messages, for
   example, must ensure that the actuator executes the command at the
   time requested and not before or after.

   It is different from the bounded latency and in-time messages.  In-
   time messages, may arrive and are valid anytime before the requested
   parameter.  The on-time constraint is that message must not be
   processed before the requested value.  Ideally, on-time request will
   have same earliest and latest values.  If OCN delivers or the AP
   processes message before the specified time then it is an error and
   may leave system in an undesirable state.

5.1.4.  Periodic messages

   Sensors emit data at regular interval but this type of information
   may not be always time-constrained but gaps between the period can
   provide an indication to the controller about the communication or
   other problems.

5.1.5.  Order of messages

   In OCN where real-time communication is the key characteristic, out
   of order message processing will lead to failures and shutdown of
   operations.  Messages may be correlated therefore, time constraints
   may be applied on a single message or a group of messages.

5.2.  Other Characteristics

   The use cases related to OCN have more stringent and finer grained
   demands from the networks and some of the characteristics are
   difficult to express as quantifiable parameters.

5.2.1.  Reliability

   Reliability is characterized by OCN's ability to deliver a packet
   successfully with the specified criteria.  OCN may implement
   different strategies to improve network reliability in response to
   router or link failures.  Some of those strategies include -
   providing redundant paths, avoiding congestion, use of reliable media
   or implementing mechanisms in software.

   It is a combination of

   *  topological reliability - i.e. having one of more paths with same
      packet delivery constraints.

   *  stability reliability - i.e. minimizing variations in packet
      delivery patterns (in terms of time, path) between two adjacent
      packets with the same constraints.

   *  forwarding reliability - i.e. replicating packets in the network
      to minimize packet losses.

   An OCN should provide sufficient telemetry data about the changes or
   anomalies in OCN as well as reasons at its earliest when it was
   unable to deliver packets in a requested fashion.

      Note: OCN may be required to report a packet loss back to
      application immediately instead of relying on conventional end-to-
      end transport mechanisms.

5.2.2.  Safety

   Safety implies several things - that the requested operation or a
   control command was executed as instructed without any adverse impact
   to the mechanical equipment or the environment.

   The traffic originating from change is triggered through commands
   delivered to actuator and the same device or different sensor Each
   OCN connection is designed or provisioned to fulfill the traffic-
   characteristics with stringent quality of services.

5.2.3.  Synchronization

   In order to support high-precision of time, some applications may use
   network clock synchronization protocols such as PTP [PTP-GRID]; while
   some other applications rely on GPS clocks.  Remaining applications
   may not use the clock synchronization at all and rely on other
   logical methods.  OCN should provide accurate delivery of packets
   through which ever methods and those methods should be opaque to the
   applications.

5.2.4.  Security

5.2.5.  Privacy

6.  OCN Examples and Realizations

   This section discusses different types of OCNs.  This section is
   include to appreciate the need for OCNs.  OCN networks may be
   deployed at different network layers as discussed below.

6.1.  Physical Layer

   An OCN network may be implemented fully on the layer one of the
   protocol stack.  It is the most trivial example of an operations and
   control in which an actuator or sensor is directly accessed from a
   controller.  For example, turning the switch on or off manually,
   turns a bulb, fan, etc on/off.  The field-devices are connected to
   controller directly over a wire.  Such type of scenarios are not part
   of the OCN, as there is no network involved.

6.2.  Link Layer

   An OCN network may be implemented on the layer 2 as a local area
   network.  In factory floors or plants, recently realtime Ethernet
   networks are deployed to meet some of the characteristics of OCN.
   The layer 2 solutions are difficult to extend and generalize beyond a
   certain distance.  It is difficult to easily integrate cloud-based
   remote control and operations specific use cases in such cases.

   Other media options include 5G radio communications that also support
   many of the OCN attributes.  Furthermore, OCN could complement these
   access network technologies by connecting them over wide areas for
   edge and cloud related accesses.

6.3.  Network Layer

   Support for large scale OC solutions requires support for all the
   characteristics end-to-end which may include crossing through
   different networks as well as interconnection of operations and
   control access networks over the internetworks while meeting all the
   requirements.  OCNs aim to achieve this. i.e., providing a network
   level approach to connecting sensors, actuators and controller from
   anywhere and meeting application constraints.

   An OCN may be implemented in the layer 3 using packet switching
   technologies and protocols.  The layer-3 OCN requires support for all
   the characteristics of messages as described above, especially for
   real-time end-to-end timing constraints.  Layer-3 OCNs may be
   deployed as a single autonomous system or as part of a single
   autonomous system.  It may involve crossing through different
   networks as well as interconnection of operations and control access
   networks while meeting all the requirements.  Layer 3 OCNs are aimed
   at large-scale, in comparison with Layer 2 OCN, and physically
   distributed manufacturing facilities and/or applications involving
   end devices of frequent mobility.
